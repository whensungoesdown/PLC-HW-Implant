\section{Implementation and Experiment}
\label{sec:implant-implementation}


This section provides the implementation details and discusses the issues that we encountered during the development. 
%We also give some experiments to prepare for attacks in different scenarios, which are not used in the current prototype.


\textbf{\texttt{Read/Write Memory.}} We briefly introduced the JTAG protocol in the background (~\autoref{sec:implant-background}) earlier. Our driver sends instructions to the IR and reads the returned result according to the JTAG state machine. Nevertheless, we need to know how to operate ARM's CoreSight components for this particular hardware backdoor prototype. We choose the JTAG interface instead of SW (Serial Wire), so the corresponding debug port is JTAG-DP or SWJ-DP, as shown in~\autoref{fig:dap}.

Through DPACC and APACC registers, the debugger can access resources provided by other access ports (AP).  As mentioned earlier, an access port provides the interface between the debug port interface and one or more debug components present within the system. There are two kinds of access ports: Memory Access Ports (MEM-AP) and JTAG Access Ports (JTAG-AP), and MEM-AP is designed for connects to memory bus system with address and data controls.  Since our backdoor wants to access memory and GPIO, we need to access either AHB-AP or the MEM-AP, which handled the differences between the underlying bus.

\end{figure}


~\autoref{fig:dpapacc} shows that both DPACC and APACC have the same structure, and they can be scan in/out through the JTAG state machine with the specific IR instruction value. The lowest bit indicates whether to read or write DP/AP, where zero means write.

 According to ARM Debug Interface Architecture Specification v5.0 to v5.2, every bank has four registers, and A[3:2], the two bits are used to select the register from the bank. The DP only has one bank, and the MEM-AP has 16 banks, as listed in~\autoref{tab:dpreg} and ~\autoref{tab:memapreg}, respectively. To select the AP's bank, we also need to write the bank address into the DP's SELECT register.

To read and write memory, we need to use the internal registers provided by the MEM-AP. Specifically, we need to sue CSW, TAR, DRW, and others. Since these registers are in the MEM-AP's bank 0, we must first use DPACC to select it. Take writing memory as an example. Next, we need to write the destination address to TAR and then write the value to DRW. ~\autoref{fig:memapwrite} shows a pseudo-code for writing memory.

\textbf{\texttt{Send/Receive SMS Message.}} SIM800C provides a serial port as the interface to receive AT commands. When \name is started, we use the AT+CMGF command to set the GSM chip in SMS Text Mode. Then we use the AT+CNMI command to set how to notify when new messages come. After that, the Teensy board keeps checking the serial port for new messages every second. If there is one, read the content and parse if it is a pre-defined attack command.

To send out a message, use the AT+CMGS command to set the destination phone number and then send the text message to the serial port. 


\textbf{\texttt{Intercepting SPI Data.}} As mentioned earlier, we can directly control the power switch chips to change the output or modify the transmission data by intercepting the bus on the circuit board, mainly low-speed buses such as SPI. For example, if we change a pin from zero to one, we need to connect it to the high voltage (3.3v) power supply to override the original signal. Similarly, we ground it to force it a zero. 
However, these operations need to consider the IC's interface.

The pins of the SPI flash chip use a push-pull configuration rather than an open drain. The output pins can actively create their own logical high and low states instead of relying on pull-up resistors to generate a default state. However, in this way, we must add an appropriate current-limiting resistor when forcing the signal to the ground or power supply to avoid short circuits.

For the SPI protocol, we modify the MOSI data line according to the CLK clock signal, and we use FPGA to implement this circuit. In each clock cycle of SPI, we first read the data transmitted on the MOSI and store it into a shift register. When finding the target pattern, we modify the following data. To meet the setup time required for the SPI data line, we choose to make the circuits work on the clock's falling edge, given that the SPI works on the rising edge.
