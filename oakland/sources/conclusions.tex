\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:implant-conclusions}

To achieve more stealthiness in a sophisticated APT attack, we think the trend is that the trojan moves towards the hardware level, especially with the emerging supply chain attacks. We present \name, a parasitical hardware implant that directly controls the PLC through wire and bus signal hijacking. \name does not modify the firmware nor relies on PLC's network communication. It can manage/damage the ICS system's physical assets by controlling PLC's IO.  At the same time, it provides a faked expected view of the system to circumvent detections. Our prototype is small in size, and the experiment results demonstrate the feasibility of \name in practice.
